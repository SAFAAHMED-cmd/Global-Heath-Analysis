The dashboard provides an interactive platform to examine various aspects of global health. Although the exact dataset details are not provided, the analysis is generally focused on:

* [cite_start]**Disease & Risk Factor Analysis:** Investigating the prevalence and impact of common global health issues (e.g., heart conditions [cite: 468][cite_start], obesity [cite: 496][cite_start], or pollution-related illnesses [cite: 513]).
* [cite_start]**Healthcare Infrastructure:** Assessing the distribution and capacity of healthcare facilities and medical teams across different regions[cite: 478, 485].
* [cite_start]**Financial and Operational Metrics:** Analyzing healthcare payment patterns and costs[cite: 501].
* **Geographic Trends:** Comparing health outcomes and resource allocation across various countries or regions to highlight areas of need.
* [cite_start]**Predictive Insights:** Utilizing visuals that may suggest future trends or risks (based on the presence of prediction-related assets [cite: 524]).
  * **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI (used for data modeling and interactive dashboard design).
* **Data Modeling & Measures:** Utilizing DAX to create essential KPIs and metrics relevant to public health (e.g., mortality rates, cost per patient, resource allocation efficiency).
* **Data Source:** A structured dataset containing global health metrics (likely including information on diseases, patient demographics, and health services).
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, transformation (using Power Query/M language), dimensional modeling, and effective data storytelling.
